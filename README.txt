Code for the paper "Provable Hierarchical Imitation Learning via EM" @ AISTATS 2021

The code is based on MATLAB R2020a, and Parallel Computing Toolbox is required. 

The 50 observation sequences used in the computation are generated by Sampling_observation.m and stored in the folder Data. 

To generate Figure 3 in the paper, first run the script Experiment_1_computation.m. The result is stored in the file Experiment_1_output,mat. Then run Experiment_1_plot.m. The output is the EPS file of Figure 3. 

To generate Figure 5, simply replace Experiment_1_plot.m with Experiment_1_plot_by_percentile.m.

To generate Figure 6 in the paper, first run the script Experiment_3_computation.m. The result is stored in the file Experiment_3_output,mat. Then run Experiment_3_plot.m. The output is the EPS file of Figure 6. 

To generate Figure 7 in the paper, first run the script Experiment_2_computation.m. The result is stored in the file Experiment_2_output,mat. Then run Experiment_2_plot.m. The output is the EPS file of Figure 7.
